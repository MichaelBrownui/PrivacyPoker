## 🎯 Game Rules

### Texas Hold'em Poker Rules

1. **Setup**: 2-6 players can join each game
2. **Ante**: All players pay a small blind to join (0.001 ETH)
3. **Dealing**: Each player receives 2 private cards
4. **Betting Rounds**:
   - **Pre-flop**: Betting based on hole cards
   - **Flop**: 3 community cards revealed, betting round
   - **Turn**: 4th community card revealed, betting round
   - **River**: 5th community card revealed, final betting round
5. **Showdown**: Best 5-card hand wins the pot

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Card Privacy**: No player or observer can see other players' cards
- **Bet Privacy**: Bet amounts remain hidden during the game
- **Action Privacy**: Players can't infer hand strength from others' actions
- **Balance Privacy**: Individual balances are encrypted and private

## 🔐 FHE Implementation Details

### Encrypted Data Types
- `euint8`: 8-bit encrypted integers for cards (1-52)
- `euint32`: 32-bit encrypted integers for balances and bets
- `ebool`: Encrypted booleans for game state flags

### Key FHE Operations
```solidity
// Random card generation
euint8 card = FHE.randEuint8();
card = FHE.rem(card, 52); // Map to 1-52 range

// Secure betting
ebool hasFunds = FHE.ge(playerBalance, betAmount);
euint32 actualBet = FHE.select(hasFunds, betAmount, FHE.asEuint32(0));

// Balance updates
playerBalance = FHE.sub(playerBalance, actualBet);
totalPot = FHE.add(totalPot, actualBet);
```

### Access Control
```solidity
// Grant permissions for encrypted data
FHE.allowThis(encryptedData);           // Contract access
FHE.allow(encryptedData, playerAddress); // Player access
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedData, recipient); // Temporary access
```

## 🧪 Testing

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All state changes before external calls
- **Integer Overflow**: Safe math operations with FHE
- **Access Control**: Strict permission management
- **Input Validation**: Cryptographic proof verification

### FHE Security
- **Privacy Guarantees**: Cards remain encrypted throughout gameplay
- **No Trusted Setup**: Uses Zama's parameter generation
- **Quantum Resistance**: FHE provides post-quantum security
- **Side-Channel Protection**: Constant-time operations

### Frontend Security
- **Wallet Integration**: Secure connection via Rainbow Kit
- **Input Sanitization**: Validation of all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes
- **State Management**: Immutable state updates

## 📊 Gas Optimization

### FHE Operation Costs
- **Card Generation**: ~50,000 gas per card
- **Betting**: ~80,000 gas per bet
- **Balance Updates**: ~60,000 gas per update
- **ACL Operations**: ~30,000 gas per permission grant

### Optimization Strategies
- **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple FHE operations
- **Efficient ACL**: Minimize permission grants
- **Smart Contracts**: Optimize storage layouts
- **Frontend**: Batch transactions where possible
